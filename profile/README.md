# noql.net


Born out of months of observing and identifying fundamental issues in delivering access to the open internet in countries with strict state-of-the-art censorship, noql.net aims to solve some of these fundamental problems.

noql.net will operate in a series of phases. These phases are designed to provide clear boundaries between current and future goals.

## Phase 1
Currently we are in Phase 1. This phase attempts to solve one of the most urgent problems with defeating censorship, building and delivering tools.
The burden of finding, installing, and updating tools to bypass internet censorship is often placed on the end-user. It's quite clear this isn't reliable.
An initial proof-of-concept attempt was made with the creation of an [apt repository](https://apt.noql.net/) for Debian and Ubuntu users. After the success of this, it's obvious that we cant stop here.


Goals of Phase 1
 - Translate various anti-censorship tools and documentation to English (censorship is not only a Chinese problem now)
 - Build infrastructure for building and distributing Android applications
 - Build infrastructure for building and distributing Windows applications
 - Build infrastructure for building and distributing macOS applications
 - Build infrastructure for building and distributing linux applications (Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, ArchLinux, NixOS, Alpine, Docker)
 - Build platform (site, bots, etc...) for easy discovery of tools, and update notifications

## Subsequent phases
These will be documented in time. Please be patient.
